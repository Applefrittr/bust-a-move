## Description
**`DISCLAIMER`**: Purely an educational project.  Not intended for commercial use.  Bust A Move and in-game characters are property of Taito Corp.

Bust A Move made a splash in the video game scene in the early to mid-1990s, becoming a staple in arcades around the world. Blending simple mechanics with addictive puzzle-solving, it laid the foundation for many games that followed, inspiring mobile puzzle gaming today.  The project goal was to explore the feasibility of recreating this classic arcade experience in a modern web environment.  Feel free to take a look under the hood for my implementation of the game mechanics.
